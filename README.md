# solar_tracking_msc_project
This repo includes the code and report for my Masters dissertation. 

I used a raspberry pi and my very basic engineering and electronic skills to blutac together servo's into various configurations.

I then mounted small 5W solar panels onto the main servo and recorded the results.

I tried several different configurations, a static panel with no tracking, a single axis tracking panel (one servo that would 
follow the sun), a dual axis tracking panel that would rotate more accurately with the sun and a dual axis panel that would 
actively try search for the brightest point in the sky instead.

My twist on this was I was testing to see how each tracking method would perform in a residential environment, so in my testing 
I mounted my minitature solar tracking platforms onto the garage and my parents home. 

This code is about three to four years old so is not representative, but its still an interesting project. I also like to do things the complicated way just for academic purposes.
