    Title: Solar energy conversion systems [electronic resource]
    Author: Jeffrey R. S. Brownson
    Description: Context and philosophy of design -- Laws of light -- Physics of light, heat, work and photoconversion -- Metereology: the many facets of the sky -- Sun-Earth geometry -- Applying the angles to shadows and tracking -- Measure and estimation of the solar resource -- Solar energy economics -- Solar project finance -- The sun as commons -- Systems logic of devices: patterns -- Systems logic of devices: optocalorics -- Systems logic of devices: Optoelectronics -- Concentration-- the pattern to manipulate light -- Project design.
    Solar energy conversion requires a different mind-set from traditional energy engineering in order to assess distribution, scales of use, systems design, predictive economic models for fluctuating solar resources, and planning to address transient cycles and social adoption. Solar Energy Conversion Systems examines solar energy conversion as an integrative design process, applying systems thinking methods to a solid knowledge base for creators of solar energy systems. This approach permits different levels of access for the emerging broad audience of scientists, engineers, architecture.
