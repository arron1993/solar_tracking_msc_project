    Description: This study describes a system that uses the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to control the motion of a two-axis sun-tracking surfaces. The present study was conducted to monitor the performance of system and measure long-term values of global solar radiation on moving surfaces in Amman, Jordan. Results are compared with those on a fixed surface tilted at 32° towards south. Preliminary measurements indicated that the use of two-axis tracking would increase daily energy collection by more than 40%. The designed system operated smoothly with precise positioning even in adverse weather conditions.
